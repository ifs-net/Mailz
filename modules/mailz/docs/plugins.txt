PLUGIN SYSTEM:
==============

MAILZ module will search in all available system and module
folders for a plugin api. One plugin file can contain 
multiple plugins for a single module.

The structure of a plugin file should be like pnmailzapi.php
in the mailz module's module folder. Take a look at this file
and you will / should understand the way it works...
